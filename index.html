    <div class="info">
        Healthy oceans and seas are essential to our existence. They cover 70 percent of our planet and we rely on them
        for food, energy and water. Yet, we have managed to do tremendous damage to these precious resources. We must
        protect them by eliminating pollution and overfishing and immediately start to responsibly manage and protect
        all marine life around the world.
        <br><br>
        The visualizations and data below present the global perspective on where the world stands today and how it has
        changed over time.
        <br><br>
        The 10 targets and 10 indicators for SDG 14. Targets specify the goals and indicators represent the metrics by
        which the world aims to track whether these targets are achieved. Below we quote the original text of all
        targets and show the data on the agreed indicators.

            Target: "Prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based
            activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution" by 2025.<br><br>

            Definition of the SDG indicator: Indicator 14.3.1 is the "average marine acidity (pH) measured at agreed
            suite of representative sampling stations" in the UN SDG framework.<br><br>
            The interactive visualization reports trends in the mean seawater pH, measured at the Aloha station in
            Hawaii. A pH of less than 7 means that a substance is acidic, lower values indicate greater acidity.<br><br>
            Ocean acidification is a consequence of increasing carbon dioxide emissions. Ocean water and carbon dioxide
            combine to form carbonic acid, as there is more carbon dioxide produced through emissions more gets absorbed
            by the ocean.<br><br>
            <b>Target</b>: "Minimize and address the impacts of ocean acidification, including through enhanced scientific
            cooperation at all levels" by 2030.

            Definition of the SDG indicator: Indicator 14.4.1 is the "proportion of fish stocks within biologically
            sustainable levels" in the UN SDG framework.<br><br>
            Fish stocks are classified as "within biologically sustainable levels" if their abundance is estimated to be
            equal to or greater than the level that can produce the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). The MSY is the
            largest long-term average catch that can be taken from a fish stock under prevailing environmental and
            fishery conditions.<br><br>
            Fish stocks become overexploited when fish are caught at a rate higher than the population can support and
            the ability of the stock to produce its MSY is jeopardized.<br><br>
            <b>Target</b>: "By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated
            fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans, in order to restore
            fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as
            determined by their biological characteristics."<br><br>

            Data for this indicator is shown in the interactive visualization.<br><br>

            The value added of marine capture fisheries indicates the prominence of marine fish related activities in the country's economy and its importance for livelihoods.
